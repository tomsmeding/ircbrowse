Snap Framework
--------------

Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can visit
the Snap project website at http://snapframework.com/.


Snap Status and Features
------------------------

The Snap core system consists of:

  * a sensible and clean monad for web programming

  * a high-speed HTTP server called "snap-server"

  * an xml-based templating system called "heist" for generating HTML that
    allows you to bind Haskell functionality to XML tags without getting
    PHP-style tag soup all over your pants

  * a "snaplet" system for building web sites from composable pieces.

Snap is currently only officially supported on Unix platforms; it has been
tested on Linux and Mac OSX, and is reported to work on Windows.


Snap Philosophy
---------------

Snap aims to be the *de facto* web toolkit for Haskell, on the basis of:

  * High performance

  * High design standards

  * Simplicity and ease of use, even for Haskell beginners

  * Excellent documentation

  * Robustness and high test coverage
